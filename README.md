Hi, my name is Lucas Bandeira and I’m a Frontend Developer :raising_hand_man:

I’m currently interested in ~~gaming~~ getting to the next level :space_invader:

Right now I’m focusing on React.js, aiming for the stars by studying with the [Rocketseat](https://www.google.com) team :rocket: :star2:

I hope to bring some interesting ideas to life in the future. :man_technologist:
